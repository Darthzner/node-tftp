v0.0.15 (28 Jan 2014)
  Server: The default request listener now sends ENOENT errors to the client
    when a GET request fails due to an error in the fs.ReadStream (basically
    file not found).
  Client: Fixed "put()".

v0.0.14 (27 Jan 2014)
  Server: Added minor validations.
  Server: Minor bugfixes.
  Added "close()".
  
v0.0.13 (26 Jan 2014)
  Server: Deny concurrent PUT requests over the same file.
  Server: The "stats" event is now emitted in a future tick. This allows to
    call the default request listener after the "stats" event and allows to
    create the stream chaining based on the values of the "stats" object.
  Server: Added "setSize()". It must be used with custom request listeners to
    set the size of the response when is a GET request.
  Better maximum size error handling.
  Server: Exposed error codes.
  Server: Now the server doesn't check for initial errors. As soon as a new
    request starts, it creates the streams and emits the "request" event.
  Minor improvements.

  The "userExtensions" property has been moved from "createClient()" to "get()",
